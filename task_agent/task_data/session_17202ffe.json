  "original_text": "The onboarding flow starts with a quick check on the customer\u2019s email to ensure it looks valid. When it passes, Salesforce is queried to see if a matching contact already exists. If no record comes back, a new contact is created with the customer\u2019s basic details and tagged as coming from the automated workflow.\n\nA welcome email is then sent through Gmail to acknowledge the customer and let them know their account is ready. Even if email delivery encounters issues, the process continues. A Slack channel is also created for internal coordination around that customer, using a cleaned-up version of the email as the channel name.\n\nOnce these touchpoints are attempted, the workflow logs a final entry summarizing the account check, any new record created, and the Slack channel information, marking the onboarding as complete.",
