When it passes, Salesforce is queried to see if a matching contact already exists. If no record comes back, a new contact is created with the customer\u2019s basic details and tagged as coming from the automated workflow.\n\nA welcome email is then sent through Gmail to acknowledge the customer and let them know their account is ready. Even if email delivery encounters issues, the process continues. A Slack channel is also created for internal coordination around that customer, using a cleaned-up version of the email as the channel name.\n\nOnce these touchpoints are attempted, the workflow logs a final entry summarizing the account check, any new record created, and the Slack channel information, marking the onboarding as complete.",

All available tools are designed for API interactions with external services (Salesforce, Gmail, Slack, etc.), not for programmatic data validation. The workflow will proceed assuming email validation occurs at the application layer before these tool-based tasks execute. The remaining tasks are properly sequenced and can be executed with the available tools."
